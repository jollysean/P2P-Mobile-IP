3.8.1. Configuration and Registration Tables

   Each home agent MUST be configured with an IP address and with the
   prefix size for the home network.  The home agent MUST be configured
   with the mobility security association of each authorized mobile node
   that it is serving as a home agent.

   When the home agent accepts a valid Registration Request from a
   mobile node that it serves as a home agent, the home agent MUST
   create or modify the entry for this mobile node in its mobility
   binding list containing:

      -  the mobile node's home address
      -  the mobile node's care-of address
      -  the Identification field from the Registration Reply
      -  the remaining Lifetime of the registration
      
3.7.1. Configuration and Registration Tables

   Each foreign agent MUST be configured with a care-of address.  In
   addition, for each pending or current registration the foreign agent
   MUST maintain a visitor list entry containing the following
   information obtained from the mobile node's Registration Request:

      -  the link-layer source address of the mobile node
      -  the IP Source Address (the mobile node's Home Address) or its
         co-located care-of address (see description of the 'R' bit in
         section 2.1.1)
      -  the IP Destination Address (as specified in 3.6.1.1)
      -  the UDP Source Port
      -  the Home Agent address
      -  the Identification field
      -  the requested registration Lifetime, and
      -  the remaining Lifetime of the pending or current registration.
      

3.6. Mobile Node Considerations

   A mobile node MUST be configured with a netmask and a mobility
   security association for each of its home agents.  In addition, a
   mobile node MAY be configured with its home address, and the IP
   address of one or more of its home agents; otherwise, the mobile node
   MAY discover a home agent using the procedures described in Section
   3.6.1.2.

   If the mobile node is not configured with a home address, it MAY use
   the Mobile Node NAI extension [6] to identify itself, and set the
   Home Address field of the Registration Request to 0.0.0.0.  In this
   case, the mobile node MUST be able to assign its home address after
   extracting this information from the Registration Reply from the home
   agent.

   For each pending registration, the mobile node maintains the
   following information:

      -  the link-layer address of the foreign agent to which the
         Registration Request was sent, if applicable,
      -  the IP destination address of the Registration Request,
      -  the care-of address used in the registration,
      -  the Identification value sent in the registration,
      -  the originally requested Lifetime, and
      -  the remaining Lifetime of the pending registration.
